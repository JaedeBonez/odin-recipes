        <p>Fall is the perfect season for butternut squash soup. Especially when adding herbs like sage and rosemary into the mix, this soup hits on a whole other level. This soup is amazingly versatile, yet simple. The aroma that fills my kitchen when I find myself cooking this amazing dish is wonderfully fragrant. An added bonus is that one squash makes <em>plenty</em> of soup for a week, which makes this recipe a great option for easy and deliciously healthy meal prep! </p>
