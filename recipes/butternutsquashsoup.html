        <h1>Butternut Squash Soup</h1>

        <img src="../img/butternut-squash-soup.jpg" alt="A delicious bowl of butternut squash soup">
        <div class="center-paragraph">
            <p>Fall is the perfect season for butternut squash soup. Especially when adding herbs like sage and rosemary into the mix, this soup hits on a whole other level. This soup is amazingly versatile, yet simple. The aroma that fills my kitchen when I find myself cooking this amazing dish is wonderfully fragrant. An added bonus is that one squash makes <em>plenty</em> of soup for a week, which makes this recipe a great option for easy and deliciously healthy meal prep! </p>

            <p>The beauty of this recipe is how easy it is to modify to your personal tastes! While I personally wouldn't claim to be vegan, the recipe I will be sharing today will be entirely vegan. I have made this recipe many times since I found it and personally like to add some coconut/heavy cream, butter, chicken stock or more fragrant spices depending on the flavor I'm craving. However, I find is a good base to modify from so thats what I want to share with you here.</p>
